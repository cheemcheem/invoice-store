### What this aims to be
An invoice manager. This was created to solve a problem of mine, it can be used to upload documents or photographs, as well as the totals of invoices.

<div style=";width:100%; display:flex; flex-direction:row; flex-wrap:wrap; justify-content:space-between;">
  <img src="/screenshots/login.png?raw=true"     height="275">
  <img src="/screenshots/date.png?raw=true"      height="275">
  <img src="/screenshots/form.png?raw=true"      height="275">
  <img src="/screenshots/uploading.png?raw=true" height="275">
  <img src="/screenshots/created-1.png?raw=true" height="275">
  <img src="/screenshots/all.png?raw=true"       height="275">
</div>

### Next steps
I hope to add:
1. Categorisation, maybe in the form of searchable tags.
2. Searching/filtering of invoices, by tag, date, total, etc.
3. Exporting all or filtered data to a CSV.
