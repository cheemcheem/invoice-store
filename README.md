### What this aims to be
An invoice manager. This was created to solve a problem of mine, it can be used to upload documents or photographs, as well as the totals of invoices.

### Next steps
I hope to add:
1. Categorisation, maybe in the form of searchable tags.
2. Searching/filtering of invoices, by tag, date, total, etc.
3. Exporting all or filtered data to a CSV.
